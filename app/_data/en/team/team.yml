title: "About us"
aboutUs: "<p>Mobile Era is organized by a team of enthusiasts across several technology companies in Oslo. We're passionate about developing mobile apps and want to see a kick-ass event in Oslo for people like ourselves. The organizing committee consists of developers who are also active in organizing open events, conferences and meetups in the Oslo developer community.</p>

<p>Although we do this mostly in our spare time and for the fun of it, the conference would not have been possible without our generous sponsors.</p>

<p>The conference organization is a non-profit legal organization registered as MOBILE ERA CONFERENCE with organization number <a href='https://w2.brreg.no/enhet/sok/detalj.jsp?orgnr=917217025'>917 217 025</a>. Any profit from the conference will be used for next years event.</p>"
