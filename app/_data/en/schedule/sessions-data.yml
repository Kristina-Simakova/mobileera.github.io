  title: "Monocultural, Redux"
  description: "Within five years many of us will be changing decade age. Some starting their twenties, others, their thirties and forties, some, their fifties. So, as each year passes, the chance that we will be working with someone who is significantly younger than us, increases. And, of course, it must also be true therefore, that as each year passes the chances of working with someone significantly older, increases. Or does it? If we look around at our community, if we look at the latest reports from Apple, Google, Facebook and others, what we actually see is an enormous skewed demographic.

Why is that? Nature has always been strongest when it is at it’s most diverse…monocultures are a weakness that is destroyed through evolution. Yet our community still often favours a specific monoculture; young, white, males.

We work in a time when the brogrammer moniker has given validity to a monoculture, where we have to have movements like #ILookLikeAnEngineer to remind us that we are not all the same, and when, despite a slew of films and TV shows about our community, it’s still rare to see any one who is of female or of colour.

All this during an age when Brexit in the UK, Trumpism in the US and the rise of right wing parties across the world have normalised previously unthinkable levels of prejudice to those not like ourselves.

This is not about ageism, racism, or sexism, this is about strength. How do we defend, evolve and cherish our community? How can we be open, welcoming, and supportive to everyone who wants to be a part of this amazing tech revolution? How, with small steps, can we be the change we want to be."

  title: "You can do better with Kotlin"
  description: "The Kotlin programming language is gaining popularity amongst the Android developer community. It’s a modern language that gives more power in everyday routines. Kotlin code generally looks cleaner and nicer, and it’s much easier to work with when you have less verbosity or code duplication. But what’s even more important, is that Kotlin is 100% compatible with all existing Java frameworks, and has good tooling in Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA.
  In this talk we’ll discuss the concepts of the language that provide the desired expressiveness, as well as additional goodies designed specifically for Android."

  This session examines the importance of lean layouts, tools for analyzing layouts and their performance, tips and techniques for making layouts leaner, common mistakes and misconceptions, and general good practices."

  title: "And then my phone became smarter: A Journey into the AWareness"
  description: "François & Syrine will take a glance at the Awareness API and apply it to music recommendations. We are all carrying tiny computers with lots of sensors. With them, we can do more than display content, we can also make these devices aware of the world around us, making them smarter. One way to do this is to leverage the Google Awareness API in order to have rich features with minimal input from the user. It can trigger events when some conditions are put together: when you are close to a certain area, when you plug in headphones, when it is cold or sunny, etc. It can also be used to directly poll the sensors and get some information about the world around you. Using all these capacities to facilitate your life, your device will know what to do and when to do it, with or without your input (as configured by the user).
  In this talk François & Syrine will show you how to improve your music experience and take it to the next stage."

During this talk I will explain main reason why we did it, which features we are using right now, problems and pitfalls that we found and solved.
  After this talk hopefully attenders will get full understanding of all new services that Google presented and will have a clear decision should they consider to use this new framework in their projects."

  description: "Use Xamarin to develop 100% native apps on iOS, Android, and Windows Phone from a single code-base.

Combining an Xamarin app with Azure App Service is a powerful combination and may save a lot of development time and complexity.

Azure App Service provides all backend functionality such as storage, push notifications, offline synchronization, authentication/authorization management, automatic scaling.

The first half of the talk will be an explanation of Xamarin concepts and architecture, together with an overview of Azure App Service and the benefits and functionality this particular platform-as-a-service provides.

The second half of the talk, I will show by live-coding how easy it is to build a simple app that works across platforms, and furthermore connect the app to an Azure App Service to provide seamless backend communication."

  title: "Building mobile apps with NativeScript"
  description: "NativeScript is a free and open source JavaScript framework for building native iOS, Android, and Windows Phone apps. Add to that Angular 2.0 with TypeScript and you will get a truly amazing combination. But I know what you’re thinking: another way of building apps? What makes NativeScript special? Here are a few cool things:
- Direct access to native APIs—no plugins required. Want to create a file on Android? Run new java.io.File()—in JavaScript!
- Completely native performance through the use of a JavaScript bridge natively available on all three mobile platforms.
- Cross-platform libraries for common use cases. Need to call a JSON API? Run http.getJSON()
- Style native apps using CSS. Yep, that’s actually a thing.

Curious about how it all works? Come learn! Architectures will be explained; apps will be built; and fun will be had by all.

This talk is a mixture of slides and real life demo. I am going to explain what is NativeScript, how it works internally, what are the benefits, what is designed to do and show how to build a mobile app with the framework.
After the talk the audience should know enough to get them started and where to find more information to build fully functional applications.

With Ionic 2, we’ve improved upon much of what made Ionic 1 great, while also keeping things simple and reducing the fatigue that developers can feel when learning a new tool. We’ll introduce you to the basic Ionic 2 concepts and build an app live."

  description: "Building apps takes time & effort, and building GOOD apps (the only kind we really care about) even more so. In this talk we'll take a look at some apps built with Fuse to see how they evolved from early design concepts to being published in the app stores.
We'll dig into visuals, animations and gestures as well as the integration of exotic platform features and backends, and we'll see why enabling designers and developers to collaborate better let's them create apps that look & feel great in much less time.
We'll also take a closer look at the new visual tooling in Fuse, specifically designed for speeding up app development and letting everyone work on real apps as if they were mere prototypes.
The «advanced» level of the talk is chosen mainly because you’ll get a lot more out of the talk if you have a certain understanding of the app development process. This doesn’t mean everyone has to be developers / designers with multiple apps under their belts, but rather that they should know some of the high-level challenges different stakeholders and roles face.
We’ll be using 3rd party apps as examples of how different teams / people implemented their projects using Fuse in the real world, and I’ll make sure there is enough of interest in there for a variety of audience types."
