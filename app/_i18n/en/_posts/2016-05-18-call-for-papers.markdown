Mobile Era will feature a mix of international and Norwegian speakers with a focus on the international crowd. The conference will give most space to experienced speakers who are experienced in speaking on their subjects, but will leave some room for more novice speakers as well.

If you are experienced in presenting a technical or design topic within mobile, we would like to hear from you. Send us a proposal below, tweet at us, or send an email.

The conference will reimburse speaker travel and hotel costs. If you want, we can also help you organize for-pay workshops during your stay in Oslo
