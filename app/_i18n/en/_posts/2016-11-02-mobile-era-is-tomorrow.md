Tomorrow Mobile Era will start for the first time and it'll be a blast!

We have sold out on tickets, sponsor stands and we'll fill up the venue! Tomorrow at 8 AM
the doors will open, be there early to grab a coffee before the keynote!

If you need to find a lunch-buddy, or would just like to discuss talks you can <a href="http://mobileera.herokuapp.com/">join our Slack</a>. This is also the best place to be if you'd
like to help shape the future of Mobile Era.

We now have apps available for both Android and iOS (thanks to our sponsor Computas) that
allow you to favorite your talks and have them accessible on-the-go:
