We are happy to announce that we are in the process of selling out the last tickets to the Mobile Era conference. To ease the final preparations, we will end the ticket sales on Friday October 28th. Please note that there are few tickets left, so if you still haven't bought your ticket, now is the time to do so!

Friday is also the end date for the ticket sales for <strong><a href="/workshops/">Mobile Era workshop</a></strong>. We have a great set of workshops and hope that many of our participants would like to make use of this opportunity:

* Vitaly Friedman - Get ready for new Adventures in Responsive Web Design!
* Wei-Meng Lee - Learn the key concepts of native iOS programming using Xcode 8 & Swift 3.0
* Christoffer Marcussen - Learn how to build native Android apps from scratch
* Samsung - Catch up with Samsung Knox platform for Enterprise App Development
* Red Hat - Learn Enterprise Mobile Application development with the Red Hat Mobile Application Platform

Admission to the workshops requires a separate ticket. We try to keep the prices as low as possible though. The workshops offered by Samsung and Red Hat are free of charge. <a href="/workshops/">Boost your career with new mobile knowledge!</a>
