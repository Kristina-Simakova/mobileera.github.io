Mobile Era is now looking for further Lightning Talk Submissions, and we are accepting applicants until <strong>Monday, October the 10th</strong>. Accepted lightning talk candidates will receive a free ticket for the conference (in the event that you have already purchased a ticket, you can bring a friend for free instead).

Lightning Talks will be 10 minutes long. The requirement is that you send the slideshow to us (in either PPTX, PDF or Keynote format) two days in advance (October 31st). We will provide a computer with the talk available. This is to avoid technical difficulties of switching computers between the presentations.
