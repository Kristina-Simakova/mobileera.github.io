 ML5 games on tiny microcontrollers \nby István 'Flaki' Szmozsánszky\, Mobil
 e & web dev @ Mozilla / DPC Consulting\n\nMany have discovered the power of
  the HTML5 canvas quite early on in the game-creator scene and started crea
 ting their own games playable across browsers\, just as they did before wit
 h flash. Now we are taking this scene one bit further and I'll show you how
  to recreate some classic and modern titles in JavaScript in "full" 1-bit p
 ixel-glory and play them on pocket-sized Arduino-based DIY gaming rigs. \n\
 n18:00  \nIncrease productivity with Design patterns\, Libraries and Tools 
 \nby Viraj Tank\,  Mobile team lead @ Sociomantic Labs\n\nAs an Android dev
 eloper\, we have plenty of choices when it comes to Design patterns\, Libra
 ries and Tools. When it comes to making a selection\, there is no right or 
 wrong choice\, it totally depends on the project requirements. \nIn this ta
 lk\, you will be learning:\n\n• MVP vs MVVM and which one to use. \n• Diffe
 rent multithreading libraries and which one to use. \n• Different boilerpla
 te code reduction libraries and which one to use. \n• Different Cache\, Dat
 abase and Network libraries and which one to use. \n• Different Testing\, D
 ebugging and Monitoring tools and libraries and which one to use. \n\n18:30
     \nPushing Performance To The Edge \nby Vitaly Friedman\, Editor-in-Chie
 f @ Smashing Magazine\n\nPerformance matters. So how do we use fancy web te
 chnologies today to make sure our website are delivered fast to the client?
  How do we choose a web font loading strategy and how do we make use of HTT
 P/2 and service workers to show our pages faster on the screen? \nIn this t
 alk\, Vitaly Friedman will be speaking about the lessons learned from perfo
 rmance optimization of Smashing Magazine\, highlighting the strategy and th
 e front-end techniques used to bring the site “up to speed”. Beware: you wo
 n’t be able to unlearn what you learn in this session!\n\n=======\n\nSpeake
